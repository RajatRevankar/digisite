                        <p>A lighting control system is an intelligent network of lighting controls which allows you to have control of the lights in a space. There are various types of lighting control systems available to you depending on your needs and desires.  A normal switch in your home that switches a light on and off is a form of lighting control. Your driveway flood lights that turn on when it detects  motion as someone pulls up to your house is also a form of lighting control.</p>
